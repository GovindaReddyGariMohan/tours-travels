            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history.
                The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means
                'work'. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word
                travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English
                travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from
                Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).
